# Canny Edge Detector

The Canny Edge Detector project focuses on extracting red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, black, and white colors from an image and applying the Canny edge detection algorithm. The objective is to identify and highlight the edges in the image, resulting in a visually striking representation.

The project begins by isolating the specified colors from the image using color segmentation techniques. Each color is extracted separately to obtain distinct regions in the image. The Canny edge detection algorithm is then applied to these regions to identify the edges based on gradients and thresholds.

The Canny edge detector algorithm involves several steps, including Gaussian blurring to reduce noise, calculating gradients and edge directions, non-maximum suppression to thin out edges, and hysteresis thresholding to determine the final edge pixels.

By applying the Canny edge detection algorithm to the extracted color regions, the project aims to produce clear and precise edges, enhancing the visual structure of the image. This can be particularly useful in applications such as image segmentation, object recognition, and computer vision.
